## What is in this repository?
This repository stores all of the data and code used to fit a dynamic occupancy model with explicit colonization terms, compare model outputs using Brier scores, and forecast model estimates across space and time. The folder organization separates the data (./data), figures from the manuscript (./figures), nimble models (./nimble), and the R code (./R).

This document describes all of the files present in the repository.
