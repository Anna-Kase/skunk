## What is in this repository?
This repository stores all of the data and code used to fit a dynamic occupancy model with explicit colonization terms, compare model outputs using Brier scores, and forecast model estimates across space and time. The folder organization separates the data (`./data`), figures from the manuscript (`./figures`), nimble models (`./nimble`), and the R code (`./R`).

This document describes all of the files present in the repository.
